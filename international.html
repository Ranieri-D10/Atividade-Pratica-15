                <h2>Inca Trail, Peru</h2>

                <img src="T1.jpg" alt="montanha">
    
                <p>Descending from the Inca Trail into Machu Pichu at sunrise is one of life's great experiences.</p>
    
               <p>Not for the faint of heart, the Inca Trail is a 42-kilometer (26-mile) trek that takes you up over two 13,000-foot passes.</P>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Annapurna Circuit, Nepal</h2>
                <img src="T2.jpg" alt="montanha">
                <P>The Annapurna Circuit trail is a 17-day, 205-kilometer, (108-mile) journey through some of the tallest peaks on the planet.</P>
                <P>The trail starts down in a steamy jungle and ascends well above the tree line.You'll top out at 5,394 meters (17,770 feet) on the Thorung Pass, where the trail is surrounded by a dazzling panorama of mountains, all over 6,096 meters (20,000 feet).</P>

                <h2>Kilimanjaro, Tanzania</h2>
                <img src="T3.jpg" alt="montanha">
                <P>Kilimanjaro is one of the most iconic sites in all of Africa, and the hike to the top is on many people's bucket list. In fact, around 30,000 people attempt this hike each year. Depending on the route, your chances of completing the trek are pretty good.</P>
                <P>The view from the top across the surrounding landscape is spectacular, especially at sunrise when most hikers try to summit. The hike up to the top and back down generally takes about five or six days, depending on your level of fitness and acclimatization rate.</P>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Everest Base Camp, Nepal</h2>
                <img src="T4.jpg" alt="montanha">
                <P>Up and down are probably the two best words to describe the Everest Base Camp hike (EBC). This 65-kilometer, one-way trail literally climbs a mountain ridge then drops down to a river, then climbs another mountain ridge as it makes its way to base camp.</P>
                <P>The hike takes 12 to 14 days on average and is high – you will max out at 5,500 meters (18,044 feet). That said, most of the walking is done in the 3,500- to 4,500-meter (11,482 to 14,763 feet) range. The air up here is thin, and any exertion seems twice as hard.</P>

            <div>
                <h2>W Circuit, Torres Del Paine NP, Chile</h2>
                <img src="T5.jpg" alt="montanha">
                <P>Located down at the southernmost region of Chile, the W Circuit in Torres Del Paine National Park, is one of the world's most famous hikes. Easily identifiable by the jagged towers of rock and glacial lakes, this rugged and remote region draws hikers from around the world.</P>
                <P>mprovements in the trail and services over the past few years have made the trail more accessible – you no longer need to carry your own gear. The hike generally takes between four and six days, and the main season is December to February. Reservations are required for accommodations and camping within the park.</P>

                <h2>Samaria Gorge, Greece</h2>
                <img src="T6.jpg" alt="montanha">
                <P>The Samaria Gorge hike is the best hike on the island of Crete and one of Crete's top attractions. Starting in pine forests, this one-way hike descends through a narrow valley, eventually ending at the Libyan Sea. The hike is just over 16 kilometers in length, and you'll drop over 1,500 meters.</P>
                <P>The first part of the hike is the steepest, where you'll descend a long series of switchbacks for about an hour before reaching the stream responsible for this incredible gorge. At this point, the trail levels out, and the remaining 13 or so kilometers are a relatively easy stroll. Around halfway through the hike, you'll come to the most famous place on the trail: a narrow gap where the sheer walls of the gorge are only a few meters apart and 300 meters high.</P>

                <h2>Cinque Terre Hike, Italy</h2>
                <img src="T7.jpg" alt="montanha">
                <P>Long regarded as one of the most beautiful hikes in Italy, the Cinque Terre hike is an easy day hike between villages perched on the rugged seashore mountains. Strolling along this ancient route with the sparkling blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea below will make you forget about the effort expended.</P>
                <P>The best way to walk the Cinque Terre hike is to start at Monterosso and end at Riomaggiore. Take your time and stop for a mid-morning cappuccino and biscotti, follow it up with a bit more walking before you stop for a delightful lunch. Tear yourself away from the view at your lunch spot and walk for a while longer until you feel the need for an afternoon espresso.</P>

                <h2>Milford Track, New Zealand</h2>
                <img src="T8.jpg" alt="montanha">
                <P>The Milford Track is a 53-kilometer (33-mile) epic trek on New Zealand's South Island that takes in some of the finest scenery the country has to offer. Over five days, you'll pass by innumerable waterfalls, including Sutherland Falls, New Zealand's highest.</P>
                <P>Cold, clear alpine lakes; beautiful meadows; glaciers; and towering mountain peaks take their turn amazing you as you stroll along each day. Accommodation is in basic alpine huts or in more comfortable private lodges, both of which need to be booked well in advance.</P>
            </div>

                <h2>Bright Angel Trail, Grand Canyon NP, USA</h2>
                <img src="T9.jpg" alt="montanha">
                <P>As you peer over the Grand Canyon rim, you'll see a hiking trail snaking its way down the cliffside across a wide plain and then dropping off again towards the Colorado River. What you are viewing is the world-famous Bright Angel Trail.</P>
                <P>This trail is 25 kilometers (15.6 miles) long and drops 1,340 meters (4,380 feet) from the south canyon rim to the water's edge at the Phantom Ranch and Bright Angel Campground. The views along the trail across and down the canyon are spectacular, and many people do portions of the trail as a day hike. The park service recommends going no farther than Indian Springs if this is your plan.</P>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>West Coast Trail, Canada</h2>
                <img  src="T10.jpg" alt="montanha">
                <P>Located along Vancouver Island's wild Pacific Coast, the West Coast Trail is one of the most spectacular maritime hikes in Canada. The trail is 75 kilometers (46 miles) long and was originally designed as a lifesaving trail for ships that foundered in the treacherous seas just offshore. The trail takes six to eight days to complete.</P>
                <P>This is a true wilderness experience. Dense rain forest lines one side of the trail, with the deep blue ocean on the other. To say this is an adventure hike might be understating things a bit: plan for wading through fast-flowing rivers, climbing over 100 ladders with your fully loaded backpack, and traversing extensive muddy stretches.</P>
